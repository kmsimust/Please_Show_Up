# Please Show Up!

## 🍵 Background

Most groups of people are struggling to make an appointment for a certain event because everyone does not have common freetime. This causes frustration, inefficient work and confusion. Currently the solutions are chat, calendar and call. 


## 🎯 Objective

‘Please show up’ is a website where groups create schedules to display as a table with dates, times and event name. Members will tick “Yes,” “No,” or “Maybe” for each appointment to let others in the group know if they are available or not. 

Attendance will be recorded which you can come back and look at the previous schedule, and there will be a system called social credit point and this point will be deducted if a person is late and does not show up with no reason despite clicking yes. The point will go up if they click yes and be on time. This will encourage people to be more responsible for an appointment.

Moreover, it will be more convenient in a project for bosses to keep track of their group and punish them according to their policies. A tier list will be displayed to make it easier to keep track of their reliability.
